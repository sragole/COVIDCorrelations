# COVIDCorrelations
Performs simple lagged cases correlations for COVID hospitalizations and deaths

This [binder notebook](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.15.1/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fsragole%252FCOVIDCorrelations%252Fmain%252FCOVIDCorrelationState.jl) should launch an instance of the notebook remotely. It takes some time to load, then you need to restart the notebook, and potentially re-run the import cell for the notebook to compile.

To view, you can download the COVIDCorrelations.jl and run in Pluto. If you just want to see a static preview, the .html will give you a snapshot of the notebook. 



### In progress
Trying to make the binder work better
